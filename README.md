## About this repo

This is my personal portfolio website used to display my projects, contact information, Resume, and some personal information about me!

It's built using React, TailwindCSS for styling and hosted on AWS with Amplify.

This project was built by myself from the ground up, and was an incredible learning experience that really pushed and improved my skills as a developer. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me using any of the methods listed on the site!
